# Elemental Crystals

Perform a periodic calculation for each element parameterised by GFN1 xTB 

### To Do's 

* Tabulate each material and its bravais lattice

* Get cifs for every element from the Materials Project, via it API    
    * https://materialsproject.org/docs/api#materials_.28calculated_materials_data.29
    
* Run each with high Ewald cut-offs and (H,S) cut-offs to guarantee convergence

* Do some comparison against plane wave calculations
